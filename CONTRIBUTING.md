# Contributing

If you'd like to contribute to this mod, please follow these simple guidelines:

- Indent your code using tabs
- Use camelCase for variable names and TitleCase for function names.
- Dont use parenthesis in 'if' statements unless necessary.
- You can't use hooks (for security, but if you know a good way to do them please let me know)
- Every function and variable has to be local, no global variables.
- Keep all code inside of the two autorun scripts.
