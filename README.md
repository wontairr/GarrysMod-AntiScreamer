# A Garry's Mod addon that aims to protect the user from "screamers" made by malicious mod creators

- Places your game in a "safe mode" where nothing can display images or play sounds while active.
- Provides a GUI that displays specific rendering/sound functions and what addons/script paths are calling them.
- Obfuscated design so that it is untamperable by attacking mods.
